# O1-Blueprints-with-SFT-Dataset
A reinforcement learning project focused on developing an advanced AI agent that learns reasoning and problem-solving capabilities through interaction with the OpenO1-SFT dataset. This project implements a custom environment and training pipeline to create an agent that can understand, reason about, and solve complex tasks.
